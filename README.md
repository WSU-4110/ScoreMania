<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
## Introduction
Our app is a point tracker for Magic: The Gathering and YuGiOh, two card games.

From the 20 to 40 health points in a Magic game to the 8,000 life points in a typical YuGiOh game, this point tracker keeps track of each player's health.
A coin flip and a dice roll function are also included in this app (both features can be found in the YuGiOh game, the dice roll is a six sided die).

<!-- FEATURES -->
## Features
Here we have all the abilities of the app. Being able to seamlessly transition from game to game. As well as tracking the life points and health of both you and your competitors. But wait there's more! With the new introduction of dice rolling and a coin flip feature, You can roll into the future and make your friends flip out (kill me). Each button is formatted to be easily used on your mobile device. The values of each button are made to be common within their respective games. Finally we made the ability to add more players so it isn't always a gruesome twosome. So try it out today!
